Professional SummarySenior Systems Architect with 15+ years of experience engineering high-reliability environments (US Navy, GoDaddy). AI-Forward Specialist: I co-build daily using Cursor (Native), Claude Code (CLI), and Gemini, maintaining a 10x shipping velocity. Expert in bridging deterministic rules engines with LLM reasoning to build &quot;Self-Oriented&quot; agents that possess persistent identity, auditable memory ledgers, and zero-hallucination action schemas.Core AI Infrastructure ProjectsBob / TURBOCOG | Lead Architect Developed a deterministic Agentic Runtime and MTG Engine that enforces 100% legal action schemas via a player-scoped visibility layer.Architecture: Engineered a &quot;Think/Recall → Respond&quot; pipeline with an approval-gated Long-Term Memory (LTM) audit ledger, preventing silent model drift.Safety &amp; Compliance: Implemented schema-constrained reasoning; the AI selects from engine-validated legal moves, mathematically eliminating &quot;rules hallucinations.&quot;Agentic Layer (TURBOTIME): Built a multi-step planning layer with tool-calling for Scryfall, Steam, and sandboxed filesystem operations.HAL (Halcyon) | Developer Built an emotional memory agent using a dual-perspective &quot;Hippocampus&quot; retrieval system.Memory Engineering: Implemented Qdrant Named Vectors to enable hybrid semantic/emotional search (Content vs. Tonal similarity).State Management: Developed the &quot;Thalamus&quot; orchestrator to manage structured cognitive states and narrative journal commits, ensuring persistent agent &quot;presence.&quot;Stack: Python 3.10+, Docker, Qdrant, OpenAI/OpenRouter-compatible HTTP I/O.T-SCAN | Creator Developed a Mechanistic Interpretability suite to probe and visualize LLM hidden states.Visualization: Built a Godot 4 3D viewer to render per-token neuron/edge graphs, allowing qualitative inspection of model &quot;circuits.&quot;Probing: Wrote custom Python hooks to log activations and compute windowed temporal correlations in Llama 3B/3.2 models.Tooling: Created a Gradio UI for real-time dimension &quot;pokes&quot; to compare baseline vs. perturbed model runs.Professional ExperienceGoDaddy | Tech LeadLed senior engineering teams in a high-scale, multi-tenant SaaS environment.Architected internal automation tools and managed complex state transitions across distributed systems, ensuring platform reliability for millions of users.United States Navy | Boiler Operator Supervisor (E-5)Managed mission-critical, high-pressure steam systems.The GCD Factor: Applied a &quot;Deterministic Rules&quot; mindset to physical infrastructure—an engineering philosophy I now use to ensure AI agent safety and auditability in SOC 2 environments.Technical SkillsAI Architecture: Agentic Infrastructure, Deterministic State Machines, Mechanistic Interpretability, Named Vector Search (Qdrant), Hippocampal Loops.Full-Stack &amp; Integrations: React, TypeScript, Node.js/Express, Python, PostgreSQL (JSONB), Docker, REST/OAuth.AI-Forward Tooling: Cursor (Power User), Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, n8n, Workato.Specific Alignment for Xceleration:The &quot;AI-Forward&quot; Engineer: I don't just use Claude; I build architectures that house models like it. My use of Cursor and Claude Code isn't for autocomplete—it's for rapid architectural iteration.Auditability &amp; Safety: My Bob architecture (approval-gated memory and deterministic schemas) is directly applicable to Xceleration’s need for SOC 2 compliant, governed AI features.Full-Stack Impact: I can contribute to your .NET/C# microservices while leading the expansion into Node.js, Python, and PostgreSQL analytics.
