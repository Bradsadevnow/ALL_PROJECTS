Steve AI Runtime | Lead Architect &amp; DeveloperJuly 2023 – PresentTransactional Architecture: Designed an atomic “Epoch” state model where system state mutates only upon explicit commit, enforcing deterministic continuity across sessions.Memory Lifecycle Management: Engineered a “Sleep Cycle” consolidation pipeline that distills raw session logs into structured SQLite/Markdown stores for long-horizon context optimization.Deterministic Tool Orchestration: Implemented strict execution gating for external APIs (Scryfall, Google, Spotify), ensuring safe failure modes and preventing model-driven protocol drift.Structured Intent Enforcement: Enforced schema-validated model output to eliminate hallucinated tool calls and maintain system integrity under degradation.Bob / TURBOCOG | Lead ArchitectAuthoritative State Control: Developed a deterministic MTG Rules Engine and agentic runtime enforcing 100% legal action schemas, eliminating rules hallucinations through player-scoped visibility constraints.Memory Governance: Designed a Think/Recall → Respond pipeline with approval-gated Long-Term Memory (LTM) audit ledger to prevent silent model drift and ensure explainable state evolution.T-SCAN | CreatorMechanistic Interpretability: Built a tooling suite to probe and analyze LLM hidden states for circuit-level inspection.3D Visualization: Developed a Godot 4 visualization engine rendering per-token neuron/edge graphs for qualitative analysis of internal model representations.PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCEGoDaddy | Tech LeadLed senior engineering teams within a high-scale, multi-tenant SaaS platform serving millions of users.Architected automation tooling and managed complex state transitions across distributed systems to maintain platform reliability.Partnered cross-functionally with Product, UX, and Data teams to drive architectural reviews and growth-critical feature delivery.United States Navy | Boiler Operator Supervisor (E-5)Operated and supervised high-pressure propulsion systems in safety-critical environments requiring strict procedural adherence.Applied deterministic protocol enforcement to physical infrastructure, ensuring 100% operational stability under high-stress conditions.EDUCATION &amp; TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTIndependent Study: Large Language Model Architecture, Distributed Systems, Full-Stack DevelopmentU.S. Navy Engineering Core Training: Advanced instruction in high-pressure systems operation, protocol enforcement, and mission-critical reliability standards.
