Bradley R Bates357 Lindsay Farm Dr.Stony Point, NC 28678916-718-7171Software Engineer · Game Systems · Rules EnginesUnited StatesGitHub: https://github.com/Bradsadevnow/bobSUMMARYSoftware engineer specializing in authoritative game engines, deterministic rules enforcement, and schema-driven control surfaces. Built a shippable Magic: The Gathering rules engine and supporting runtime designed to prevent invalid behavior by constraining play through legal action schemas and engine-owned state. Focused on correctness, debuggability, and human-auditable behavior in complex rules-driven systems.TECHNICAL PROJECTSmtg_core — Principal ArchitectAuthoritative Magic: The Gathering Rules Engine (Phase-1, Shippable)Designed and implemented a deterministic MTG rules engine in Python acting as the single source of truth for all game state mutation, independent of UI or control surfaces.Enforced 15+ trigger types (ETB, dies, combat damage, etc.) with deterministic ordering and resolution.Implemented engine-owned action validation and resolution, ensuring all player actions are legality-checked against current game state to prevent invalid plays and rules drift.Built a player-scoped visibility system (VisibleState) that enforces hidden information boundaries while enabling safe legal action enumeration for downstream clients.Engineered a schema-driven action surface that enumerates all legal moves per priority window, allowing multiple clients (CLI, UI, automated players) to operate without embedded rules logic.Implemented full Phase-1 MTG gameplay loop, including:Priority passing and stack resolutionSorcery and instant timing rulesMana production and cost payment (including X, alternate, and additional costs)Combat (attackers, blockers, keywords, damage resolution)State-based actions and win checksDeveloped a data-driven card rules system using Scryfall-derived schemas, parsing oracle text into keywords, effects, triggered abilities, and activated abilities only as required by the active card pool.Enforced complex mechanics including equipment, auras, flashback, goad, menace, lifelink, trample, deathtouch, and first/double strike, with deterministic resolution.Designed the engine to support automated players by eliminating ambiguity, undefined behavior, and reliance on natural-language rule interpretation.Bob Runtime — Principal ArchitectHuman-Auditable Runtime for Rules-Driven GamesArchitected a clean-slate runtime with authoritative state management, append-only telemetry, and strict separation between system truth and decision logic.Designed a dual-layer control model:Deterministic engines (e.g., mtg_core) as ground truthDecision layers restricted to schema-defined legal actions and tool-mediated queriesImplemented an approval-gated memory system:Short-Term Memory (STM) for bounded local continuityLong-Term Memory (LTM) writes requiring explicit human approval with a permanent audit ledgerBuilt a tool sandbox and gating model to safely expose external systems (game databases, filesystem, metadata services) without uncontrolled behavior.Designed the runtime to support human-in-the-loop review, debugging, and replay, prioritizing trust and observability.Integrated MTG-specific memory boundaries to prevent leakage of hidden information while allowing durable learning of player preferences, strategic lessons, and tutoring style.TECHNICAL SKILLSGame &amp; Systems EngineeringRules Engines · Deterministic Simulation · Action Schema Design · State Machines · Turn-Based Systems · Control SurfacesLanguages &amp; ToolsPython (3.10+) · GDScript (Godot 4) · JSON / JSON-LD · Asynchronous Programming · Secure Tooling &amp; SandboxingUI &amp; DebuggingDear PyGui · Gradio · Textual · Godot · High-Dimensional Data Visualization
